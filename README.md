# Sounds-CSC780
Sounds is a conceptual social media platform revolves around music. Users can post about what they heard outside with music recognition, share a song that they like, or just simply make a text post. (This will be the term project for my app development class!)

The following is a tentative list of features to be implemented:

## Must have features
- Register / login / logout
- Feed that displays posts from all users
- Like posts
- Make a post from the result of searching for a song (Genius / Spotify api)
- Make a pure text post
- Posts with music information embedded
- Personal profile with customizable profile picture and status message
- See your own posts
- Delete posts

## Good to have features
- Make a post from the result of music recognition (ShazamKit)
- Reposting
- Add comment to posts
- Quote lyrics when posting
- Add recording from music recognition to posts
- Add pictures to posts
- Add music from other's posts to a personal collection
- Following others
- Feed with posts from following users only
- Follower count
