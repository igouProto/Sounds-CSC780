# Sounds-CSC780
Sounds is a conceptual social media platform revolves around music. Users can post about what they heard outside with music recognition, share a song that they like, or just simply make a text post. (This will be the term project for my app development class!)

The following is a tentative list of features to be implemented:

## Must have features
[x] Register / login / logout
[x] Feed that displays posts from all users
[x] Like posts
[x] Make a post from the result of searching for a song (Genius / Spotify api)
[x] Make a pure text post
[x] Posts with music information embedded
    [x] Clicking on the album art brings up Genius page
[x] Personal profile
[x] See your own posts
[x] Delete posts
